lol things i still wanna update...
1. script to use elbow method and get k means and silhouette score
2. write all the data to a csv file
3. parse the other data -- or write algorithms for each of them (parsing might be easier)
4. the ideal solution is given, write that to another csv file to use as test data

algorithms to incorporate:
1. nearest neighbor
2. nearest insertion
3. farthest insertion
4. cheapest insertion
5. branch and bound (yikes)
5. christofides algorithm (double yikes)
6. 2 - opt
7. 3 - opt
8. lin-kernighan (probably won't get to)
