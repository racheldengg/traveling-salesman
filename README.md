# traveling-salesman
final project for matd94

algorithms to implement:
1. -- nearest neighbor --
2. nearest insertion
3. farthest insertion
4. cheapest insertion
5. christofides algorithm (double yikes)
6. MST heuristic (Prim and Kruskal)
7. lin-kernighan (probably won't get to :/)
8. genetic algorithms
9. ant colony optimization

data to collect: 
1. total distance
2. total time taken to run
   ----------------------
4. number of cities
5. how spread out the cities are from each other (standard deviation)
6. number of clusters
7. how spread out the clusters are from each other
8. total time taken to run
**7. sparsity/density **

end goal: determine which algorithm results in the best runtime/tour

remove .DS_store in terminal: find . -name '.DS_Store' -type f -delete
