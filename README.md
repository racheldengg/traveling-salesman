# traveling-salesman
final project for matd94

algorithms to implement:
1.  <strike> nearest neighbor </strike>
2. <strike> nearest insertion </strike>
3. <strike> farthest insertion </strike>
4. <strike> cheapest insertion </strike>
5. christofides algorithm (double yikes)
6. <strike> MST heuristic (Prim and Kruskal) </strike>
7. lin-kernighan (probably won't get to :/)
8. genetic algorithms
9. ant colony optimization

data to collect: 
1. total distance
2. quantified big O value

   ----------------------
4. number of cities
5. how spread out the cities are from each other (standard deviation)
6. number of clusters
7. how spread out the clusters are from each other (inter-cluster variance)
8. sparsity/density

end goal: determine which algorithm results in the best runtime/tour

remove .DS_store in terminal: find . -name '.DS_Store' -type f -delete
