# traveling-salesman
final project for matd94

algorithms to implement:
1. nearest neighbor
2. nearest insertion
3. farthest insertion
4. cheapest insertion
5. branch and bound (yikes)
5. christofides algorithm (double yikes)
6. 2 - opt
7. 3 - opt
8. lin-kernighan (probably won't get to :/)

data to collect: 
total distance
number of cities
how spread out the cities are from each other (standard deviation)
number of clusters
how spread out the clusters are from each other

remove .DS_store in terminal: find . -name '.DS_Store' -type f -delete
