# traveling-salesman
final project for matd94

algorithms to implement:
1. nearest neighbor
2. nearest insertion
3. farthest insertion
4. cheapest insertion
5. branch and bound (yikes)
5. christofides algorithm (double yikes)
6. 2 - opt
7. 3 - opt
8. lin-kernighan (probably won't get to :/)

data to collect: 
1. total distance
2. number of cities
3. how spread out the cities are from each other (standard deviation)
4. number of clusters
5. how spread out the clusters are from each other
6. total time taken to run
**7. sparsity/density **

end goal: determine which algorithm results in the best runtime/tour

remove .DS_store in terminal: find . -name '.DS_Store' -type f -delete
